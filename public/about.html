<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I recently found out was that I have more spatial awareness that the average soccer 
  players where I am able to see the game from a eagle view and helps me play as an effective mid-field player which 
  I find something that I am grateful about.</p>

  <p>As an engineer I have always had 2 things consistent from the very start of high school that I would never limit myself to learn 
  anything and use all the knowledge at my disposal to create something that would eventually be used as a service by the society and 
  the community of people I love within.This is very important to me because I want to become an engineer that aligns with my personal 
  core value,I have always been a person to help others and that keeps me going and if I manage to do that with my CS career.</p>

<p>I have always been a regular soccer player since I was 13, but I never actually made the best out of the sport until I joined my 
  city's soccer club. The team was like a second family to me and the memories I made with them will stay forever with me. I learned 
  the true importance of teamwork and brotherhood. Pushing myself every day to become a better soccer player helped me shape my mentality 
  and made me more consistent with everything in my life. I would describe this period of my life as the most productive time and an 
  experience that helped me understand human relations and their importance. My coach made it all possible, he trusted me even when I 
  made mistakes and helped me improve and understand the game from a different perspective. I will forever be grateful for the help I got 
  and the community that made it all possible.</p>
